# Redux Migration Status

## Completed
1. **Auth State Management Migration**
   - Created Redux auth slice with all required authentication operations
   - Created bridging provider (AuthReduxProvider) for backward compatibility
   - Implemented socket connection management through AuthenticatedAppWrapper component
   - Updated Root.js and AppNavigator.js to use the new Redux-based auth state

2. **Previous Migrations**
   - Messages state management with Redux
   - Contacts state management with Redux
   - Socket middleware for Redux

## To Do
1. **Remove Context-Only Components**
   - Once the app is stable with the current implementation, gradually remove:
     - Original AuthProvider and methods in AuthContext.js
     - ContactsContext and related functionality
     - MessagesContext and related functionality

2. **Direct Redux Usage**
   - Refactor components to use Redux directly via hooks:
     - Replace useAuth() with useSelector() and useDispatch()
     - Replace useContacts() with useSelector() and useDispatch()
     - Replace useMessages() with useSelector() and useDispatch()

3. **Socket Event Management**
   - Ensure all socket events properly dispatch Redux actions
   - Optimize socket connection and event management

## Architecture Notes
- The current implementation is a transitional architecture that combines:
  - Redux for state management (Auth, Contacts, Messages)
  - Context API for backward compatibility and UI state (Theme, AppLifecycle, Orientation)
  - Socket middleware for real-time communication

- We're using providers that bridge between Redux and Context API to maintain backward compatibility while we migrate the entire app.

- Socket connections are now properly initiated only after authentication is confirmed.

## Test Areas
- Authentication flow (login, register, logout)
- Socket connection management
- State persistence across app restarts
- Proper handling of avatar images and user profiles
